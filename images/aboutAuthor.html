			<div class="detail">
				<p>My name is Isaac Hormel and I write code.</p>
				<p>It all started way back in middle school. Back then, I didn't know a thing about coding. I had no real teacher, even though I really wanted to learn. I started at first by looking at some videos on classical languages, Java and C++, but I was realistically too young to understand what I was doing. Soon I settled on HTML, and instantly I was writing code.</p>
				<p>I learned the ways of early HTML, css, and JavaScript, quickly learning the limitations of the languages. Soon, I would be moving on to harder, more advanced languages.</p>
				<p>In highschool, Java became my love. I learned all I could about the language, going so far as to outshine even my own teachers. And when I eventually got to college, I was surprised to discover that I had even surpassed my teacher's assistants. </p>
				<p>After doing some thinking, I came to the conclusion that I would not need to go to a college or university to become a programmer. I would handle the learning on my own. And since then, I have come far - learning more and more about programming with each passing day.</p>
				<p>Now here I am, working on becoming certified in my knowledge and improving it through a coding bootcamp in Austin. I hope to improve my skills as a programmer and enter the field of information technology with the right foot forward.</p>
